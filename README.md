- General aesthetic and usability improvements

# Documentation
Lore Engine Legacy is primarily undocumented. Documentation is in the works, but it will likely be a bit of time before it's in a state I'm comfortable with making available. If you can't gleam how something works from the source code, feel free to shoot me a DM on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/dotevie.com),
